The objective of this project is to develop an IT help desk ticket system designed to streamline the process of submitting and managing IT support requests. Users will be able to submit tickets for issues such as account assistance and repair requests.
Key features of the system include:
  Automatic Ticket Assignment: The system will automatically assign tickets to individual IT staff members based on predefined criteria.
  Built-in Calendar: A robust calendar feature to manage the high volume of tickets, ensuring efficient scheduling and tracking.
  Communication Tools: Support for both asynchronous messaging and live chat between ticket submitters and IT staff to enhance communication and resolution efficiency.
The system must be capable of running on multiple machines while accessing a central database. 
During the development and testing phases, a local database will be used, but the design will ensure it can function seamlessly when connected to a central server database.
